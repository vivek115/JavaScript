var a=15;
let a=15;
const a=16;

// var ,let and const are the variable used in javascript
// let and const are introduced in ES6 version

// null and undefined are also the two datatypes

// we can't redeclare variable(variable with same name whiich is already exist) with 
// let keyword but possible with var
// Reassingning is allowed with let and var variable


let required = true;
console.log(!required);

// Difference between let and const
// Reassigning is not allowed in const variable but we can do with let variable.
